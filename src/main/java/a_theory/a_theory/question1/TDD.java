    // Description above would work for a metal band.
    // What does TDD stand for in IT?
    // Answer: TDD (Test Driven Development) is an approach where test cases are made to force developer
    // adopting his code in order to pass the tests. This structure keeps code clean and eliminates possible bugs.

    //todo p2
    // Can you describe 3 rules of TDD? In your words (no wiki definitions)
    // 1st rule tells us to begin with writing tests such that structure of the system is depended on tests
    // 2nd rule: There are enough tests if it is sufficient to fail, in other words a program should run tests as
    // incrementally as possible
    // 3rd rule: write as few lines of code as possible to pass the failed test. So if we failed because we created
    // an object of not yet existing class then in order to pass the test the only thing we need to do is to assign
    // the missing class.

    //todo p3
    // Who popularized the concept of TDD?
    // Answer: Kent Beck (2003)

    //todo p4
    // Can you name their most famous book?
    // Answer: Test Driven Development: By Example. by Kent Beck. November 18, 2002
