    // smoke testing - Software testing where only most fundamental functionality is being tested.
    // On this stage of testing the goal is to decide whether the system is ready for further testing or not
    // The technic helps to identify integration, system errors. Smoke testing is performed after sanity and
    // before functional level.
    // Usually this kind of tests is run manually but sometimes companies could use automated tests.
    // Examples: Check sign out functionality - select sign out button - The user should be able to sign out -
    // - User is not able to sign out - Fail

    //todo p2
    // regression testing - a software testing to verify that recent feature update hasn't ruined existing functionality
    // The approach has 3 basic technics:
    //  1. retest all - all test are re-executed
    //  2. regression test selection - some selected test cases from test suite are executed
    //     to test whether the modified code affects the software application or not
    //  3. prioritisation of test cases - picking test cases depending on business impact, critical & frequently used functionalities
    // If software is updated often then it is a good idea to use automation for performing such tests.
    // Frameworks: Selenium, Ranorex Studio etc.
