     In Software Engineering, Recoverability Testing is a type of Non- Functional Testing
     Recovery process can be broken down to: Normal operation
     Disaster occurrence
     Disruption and failure of the operation
     Disaster clearance
     Reconstruction of all processes and information to bring the whole system to move to normal operation

     Usability Testing is a testing for measuring how easy and user-friendly a software application is.
     The goal of this testing is to satisfy users and it mostly focuses on the following parameters of a system:
     1. Efficiency
     2. Accuracy
     3. User Friendliness
     There are two main technics Laboratory Usability Testing and Remote Usability Testing
     The first one is when testing is conducted in a separate lab room in presence of the observers. The testers are assigned tasks to execute.
     The role of the observer is to monitor the behavior of the testers and report the outcome of testing.
     The second one is when observers and testers are remotely located.
     Testers access the System Under Test, remotely and perform assigned tasks
     UX Testing Checklist - common practice to identify if an app is user friendly or not. For example IOS App store
     has stricter check lists than play store
     UX testing pros:
     It helps uncover usability issues before the product is marketed
     It helps improve end-user satisfaction
     It makes your system highly effective and efficient
