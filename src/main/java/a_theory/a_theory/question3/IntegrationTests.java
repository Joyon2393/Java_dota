    // What are integration tests? In your words (don't use wiki definitions)
    // Answer: Tests where several units are tested together to make sure system behaves as expected

    //todo p2
    // Name 2 benefits of integration tests
    // 1 it protects from bugs related to interaction between integrated components/modules
    // 2 works faster than end to end testing

    //todo p3
    // Name 1 disadvantage of integration tests
    // 1 not as fast as unit tests

    //todo p4
    // Name 2 integration test frameworks or libraries
    // 1 JUnit and Spring test (in pair)
    // 2 Selenium

    //todo p5
    // Would you use mocking with integration tests?
    // Yes/No: No
    // Why?
    // The main goal is to verify that integrated system operates as expected so we can't verify
    // when using mocked objects (expect few cases I found on the internet but in general the answer is no)
