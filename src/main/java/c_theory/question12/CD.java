    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: Release to repository

    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: more frequent release of software e.g. update/fix small parts of a system instead of
    // waiting for months until huge changes are made and released

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick which ones stand for continuous delivery
    // [] compile
    // [x] test
    // [] deploy (continuous deployment part)

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CD
    // 1 It's secure. As it's no longer needed to manually realise software. A developer can setup secure
    // way of delivery and it will run over and over again without interruption

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CD
    // 1 team needs to cooperate perfectly to keep track on changes

    //todo F
    // Which one is more important to start with CI or CD? Why?
    // CI/CD: CI
    // Because: First we build, test, merge code and then work out the way to automated delivery
